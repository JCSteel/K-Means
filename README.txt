I made the program in Java using Eclipse. To execute it, do the following...
Place the kmeans.txt file in the src folder. If you run this through Eclipse, it may need to be in the root folder.
Then, in zeus or eros, navigate to the src folder and type the following command
java kmeans.Driver k kmeans.txt (replacing k with the number of clusters)
